Custom Chatbot Using TensorFlow
The Custom Chatbot project utilizes TensorFlow to develop an advanced conversational AI capable of understanding and responding to user queries with precision and efficiency. This chatbot employs modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques and neural network architectures to provide an engaging user experience.

Key Features
Intent Recognition:

Incorporates pre-trained word embeddings and custom neural networks for accurately classifying user inputs into predefined intents.
Supports multiple intent categories, including FAQs, task automation, and casual interactions.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Implements essential NLP processes such as tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words to preprocess user inputs.
Utilizes TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer or custom embedding layers to transform text into machine-readable formats.
Customizable Response System:

Static responses are defined for straightforward interactions using intent-response mappings.
Dynamic responses are generated through sequence models like LSTMs or Transformer-based architectures for more complex scenarios.
Scalable Model Design:

Built with TensorFlow's Sequential and Functional APIs, allowing flexibility in model architecture.
Includes options for transfer learning to enhance language understanding.
Training and Optimization:

Trained on labeled intent datasets using TensorFlow's Model.fit() function.
Optimized with advanced techniques such as early stopping, dropout regularization, and adaptive learning rate scheduling.
Deployment and Integration:

Exported as a TensorFlow SavedModel for seamless deployment across platforms.
Easily integrates with web frameworks (e.g., Flask or Django) or messaging applications for interactive use.
Technical Specifications
Framework: TensorFlow 2.x
Data Format: Labeled datasets (JSON or CSV) with user queries and associated intents.
Neural Architectures: Dense networks, RNNs, or Transformers.
